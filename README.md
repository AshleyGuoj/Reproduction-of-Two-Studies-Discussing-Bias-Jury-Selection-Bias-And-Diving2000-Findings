# Project Folder: Reproduction of Bias Studies

# This project folder contains five subfolders, each pertaining to different 
# papers and datasets related to the exploration of bias in various contexts. 
# Below is a brief overview of each subfolder:

# 1.paper: Nationalistic Judging Bias in the 2000 Olympic Diving Competition
#    - This subfolder contains the original paper titled "Nationalistic Judging
# Bias in the 2000 Olympic Diving Competition," authored by John W. Emerson and 
# Silas Meredith. The paper investigates potential nationalistic bias among 
# judges during the Olympic diving competition and presents scoring data to 
# support its findings.

# 2.paper: Is There a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?
#    - Inside this subfolder, you will find the original paper titled "Is There 
# a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?" authored by Hillel
# Y. Levin and John W. Emerson. The paper examines the presence of biases 
# against education in the jury selection process within the United States 
# District Court for the District of Connecticut.

# 3. Diving2000
#    - This subfolder contains the dataset and relevant materials used in the 
# replication study of the "Nationalistic Judging Bias in the 2000 Olympic 
# Diving Competition" paper. It includes the dataset of diving scores and judges'
# evaluations for analysis.

# 4. JurySelection
#    - Inside this subfolder, you will find the dataset and materials for 
# replicating the study on biases in the jury selection process, as described in 
# the "Is There a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?" paper. 
# The dataset includes information on jury composition and educational backgrounds.

# 5. Our paper: Reproduction of two studies discussing bias: Jury Selection Bias
# and Diving2000 Findings
#    - This subfolder contains our replication paper titled "Reproduction of two 
# studies discussing bias: Jury Selection Bias and Diving2000 Findings," where 
# we present our methodology and findings. Our goal is to validate the 
# reproducibility of the methods used in the two original papers and to 
# contribute to the reliability and credibility of the scientific knowledge in 
# the areas of bias in jury selection and nationalistic judging. In this folder, 
# you will find our replication code in the "code.R" file, detailed analysis, 
# and conclusions.

# We encourage researchers and interested readers to explore these subfolders 
# to gain insights into the intriguing topics of bias in critical decision-making 
# processes. Our meticulous replication efforts aim to contribute to the scientific 
# understanding of biases and their implications in various domains, thereby 
# fostering the advancement of unbiased and fair practices.

# code.R
# This file contains the R code we developed to replicate the methods and analyses 
# presented in the original papers. The code includes data processing, statistical 
# tests such as t-tests and permutation tests, data visualization, and other 
# relevant procedures. Feel free to review the code to understand our replication 
# process and verify the robustness of our findings.

# Please note that reproducing the studies requires access to the original 
# datasets from the respective subfolders (3. Diving2000 and 4. JurySelection). 
# We have ensured that our code is well-documented and easy to understand, 
# making it accessible to other researchers interested in validating the results 
# and extending the research in this critical area of bias exploration.

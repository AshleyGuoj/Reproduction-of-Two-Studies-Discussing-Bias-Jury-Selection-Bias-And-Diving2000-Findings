# Reproduction of Bias Studies

This repository contains materials related to the reproduction of bias studies, focusing on nationalistic judging bias and jury selection bias. The project folder is divided into five subfolders, each pertaining to different papers and datasets used in the replication efforts. Below is an overview of each subfolder and its contents.

## Subfolders

### 1. Paper: *Nationalistic Judging Bias in the 2000 Olympic Diving Competition*
   - This subfolder contains the original paper titled *"Nationalistic Judging Bias in the 2000 Olympic Diving Competition,"* authored by John W. Emerson and Silas Meredith. The paper investigates potential nationalistic bias among judges during the Olympic diving competition and presents scoring data to support its findings.

### 2. Paper: *Is There a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?*
   - This subfolder includes the original paper titled *"Is There a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?"* authored by Hillel Y. Levin and John W. Emerson. The paper explores biases against education in the jury selection process within the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.

### 3. Diving2000
   - This subfolder contains the dataset and relevant materials for replicating the study on nationalistic judging bias in the 2000 Olympic Diving Competition. It includes diving scores and judges' evaluations for analysis.

### 4. JurySelection
   - This subfolder contains the dataset and materials for replicating the study on biases in jury selection, as discussed in the *"Is There a Bias Against Education in the Jury Selection Process?"* paper. The dataset includes information on jury composition and educational backgrounds.

### 5. Our Paper: *Reproduction of Two Studies Discussing Bias: Jury Selection Bias and Diving2000 Findings*
   - This subfolder contains our replication paper titled *"Reproduction of Two Studies Discussing Bias: Jury Selection Bias and Diving2000 Findings."* Our paper presents the methodology and findings from our replication efforts. Our goal is to validate the reproducibility of the methods used in the two original papers and contribute to the reliability and credibility of the scientific knowledge in the areas of bias in jury selection and nationalistic judging. This folder also includes:
     - `code.R`: The R code developed for the replication of the original studies. It contains data processing, statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, permutation tests), and data visualization.

## Code

- **`code.R`**  
   This file contains the R code used to replicate the methods and analyses presented in the original papers. The code includes procedures for:
   - Data processing
   - Statistical testing (e.g., t-tests, permutation tests)
   - Data visualization  
   The code is well-documented to make the replication process transparent and accessible to other researchers interested in validating or extending this research.

## How to Reproduce the Studies

To reproduce the studies, you will need access to the original datasets found in the following subfolders:
- [3. Diving2000](#3-diving2000)
- [4. JurySelection](#4-juryselection)

The `code.R` file is designed to be user-friendly and is well-commented, ensuring that researchers can easily follow along and reproduce the analyses presented in the original studies.

## Contribution to Bias Research

Our meticulous replication efforts aim to contribute to the scientific understanding of biases and their implications in critical decision-making processes, such as jury selection and sports judging. By validating these studies, we hope to foster the advancement of unbiased and fair practices in various domains.
